                                                              2nd Submission Objective

1. You can now incorporate the feedback and complete the data collection exercise by 2nd October 2023, 6 p.m.
2. The CSV data file and a small write in Quarto explaining the data file (variables) and other details will be needed for submission. 
3. Extending the proposal document itself after incorporating the feedback will be better.
4. Doing this will allow you to build the final report in parallel. Before midterm, we will ask you to show one of the faculties 
how the data was collected (authenticity of data) before releasing the midterm grades.
