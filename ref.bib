  abstract = {Klappentext: This is the second, revised and expanded edition. The first edition was published under the slightly longer title "How to Take Smart Notes. One Simple Technique to Boost Writing, Learning and Thinking - for Students, Academics and Nonfiction Book Writers". The key to good and efficient writing lies in the intelligent organisation of ideas and notes. This book helps students, academics and other knowledge workers to get more done, write intelligent texts and learn for the long run. It teaches you how to take smart notes and ensure they bring you and your projects forward. The Take Smart Notes principle is based on established psychological insight and draws from a tried and tested note-taking technique: the Zettelkasten. This is the first comprehensive guide and description of this system in English, and not only does it explain how it works, but also why. It suits students and academics in the social sciences and humanities, nonfiction writers and others who are in the business of reading, thinking and writing. Instead of wasting your time searching for your notes, quotes or references, you can focus on what really counts: thinking, understanding and developing new ideas in writing. Dr. Sönke Ahrens is a writer and researcher in the field of education and social science. He is the author of the award-winning book “Experiment and Exploration: Forms of World Disclosure” (Springer). Since its first publication, How to Take Smart Notes has sold more than 100,000 copies and has been translated into seven languages},

The major objectives of the study were to determine the factors affecting success of business incubators and identify impact level of those factors. An empirical study was conducted so as to insights and ideas. European business incubator managers interviewed, questionnaires were administered. Primary data was collected through the use of interviews with experts and questionnaires were administered to the entrepreneurs in Europe. Purposeful sampling was used to derive some expert knowledge and random sampling for the entrepreneurs. Data analysis was done using measures of central tendency, correlation analysis to identify the strength of relationship between dependent and independent variables, the ANOVA and regression analysis. The researchers found out that business incubators are of vital relevance during the start-up and growth of business. The present analysis empirically evidenced that three main factors such as availability and access to external financial resources, strong social and business networks, and internal strength including resources and capabilities positively affect and have a strong relationship with the success of business incubators.},

The purpose of the work is to analyze the possibilities and experience of evaluating the effectiveness of training at a corporate university in order to identify tools that can be used to evaluate various performance indicators and to determine which of them can be transferred to other educational organizations. Possible shortcomings of the implementation of corporate training in the format of a corporate university as a separate legal entity are shown. To achieve this goal, we have identified suitable tools for evaluating the effectiveness of corporate training and evaluating its applicability in practice. As a result, the authors determined that the assessment of the effectiveness of corporate training in terms of indicators of the 1st and 2nd levels of the Kirkpatrick methodology can be easily carried out using various tools. Corporate universities usually use the necessary surveys during and after training for this purpose. The authors proposed to apply various methods of post-program support using appropriate educational technologies and mandatory assessment of participants sometime after training.},

  abstract = {Incubators have become a ubiquitous phenomenon in many parts of the world and are viewed as a tool for promoting the development of technology-based growth firms. Considering the large faith and the considerable amounts of money invested in incubators, the identification of best practice incubator models is of importance. Previous incubator assessment literature has tended to emphasise the measurement of incubator outcomes. In this paper, we argue that best practice identification requires a holistic approach, where the goals of the incubators are taken into account and the performance of different incubators are put in relation to their incubator models. In this context, the aim of this paper is to develop a framework that can serve as a basis for identifying best practice incubator models and for more rigorous evaluations of incubator performance. The framework suggested includes three distinguishing model components: selection, business support and mediation. We distinguish between idea-focused selection and entrepreneur-focused selection as well as between “picking-the-winners” and “survival-of-the-fittest” selection. Business support is seen as a continuum from “laissez-faire” to “strong intervention”. Mediation strategies vary in terms of the type of innovation system in focus: technological, regional or cluster. The framework is applied to 16 Swedish incubators.},

At face value, this kind of systemic approach to entrepreneurship offers a new and distinctive path for scholars and policy makers to help understand and foster growth-oriented entrepreneurship. However, its lack of specification and conceptual limitations has undoubtedly hindered our understanding of these complex organisms. Indeed, the rapid adoption of the concept has tended to overlook the heterogeneous nature of ecosystems. This paper provides a critical review and conceptualisation of the ecosystems concept: it unpacks the dynamics of the concept; outlines its theoretical limitations; measurement approaches and use in policy-making. It sets out a preliminary taxonomy of different archetypal ecosystems. The paper concludes that entrepreneurial ecosystems are a highly variegated, multi-actor and multi-scalar phenomenon, requiring bespoke policy interventions.},

Whilst it is accepted that incubation models have evolved, little is known about whether existing incubators have adjusted their value proposition to incorporate recent incubation paradigms or have simply remained operating as originally founded. We present data collected within seven BIs and their tenants regarding service provision and selection criteria. Our findings show that whilst BIs of all generations offer similar support services, tenants in older generation BIs make less use of the BI's service portfolio. We suggest this is a consequence of slack selection criteria and the absence of clearly defined exit policies. These results imply that older generation BIs should update their service portfolio while simultaneously imposing stricter selection criteria and introducing exit policies. Finally, we discuss the wider implications this raises for BIs' managers, prospective tenants and policy makers.},

  abstract = {Start-up accelerators, a relatively new and competitive type of business incubators, are nowadays considered to be a highly effective way of providing venture support. Start-ups who have been supported through accelerators have an approximately 23\% higher survival rate than other new businesses. This positive effect can be explained by the highly selective process accelerators apply when deciding on which venture projects to support. It comes as no surprise that understanding this process and the respective selection criteria is at the core of accelerator/incubator literature within entrepreneurship research. Existing research is however limited to the investigation of commercial accelerators which provide support to start-ups having an economic purpose only. Hence those academic findings cannot be simply extrapolated to accelerators supporting ventures combining economic goals with social and ecological purpose. Given the growing meaning of sustainability entrepreneurship and hence the increasing number of sustainability-oriented accelerators, the above limitation seems to be an important research gap. This paper addresses the above gap by investigating the selection processes and criteria of so-called impact accelerators focusing on the support of start-ups expected to create not only economic outcomes but also positive social and/or environmental impact. Building on existing accelerator literature, we qualitatively investigate the selection processes and criteria of nine European impact accelerators. By comparing our findings with existing research, we identify important differences between the selection approach of commercial and impact accelerators thus contributing to sustainability entrepreneurship research and practice.},

While the number of seed accelerators worldwide has grown exponentially, there is as yet no consensus on how to measure and analyse their performance. Therefore, the present study, using two pioneering surveys, aims to cast new light on this field by empirically assessing the performance of accelerators and the prospects of their accelerated firms. A model is built on two perspectives that are used to assess the prospects of the accelerated firms: (1) the accelerator´s perspective, and (2) the accelerated start-ups’ perspective. The results confirmed, at statistically significant levels, that the portfolio size of accelerators, their start-ups´ survival rates, and the number of employees in the accelerated firms, have a positive effect on the median value of the funding received by the accelerated start-ups from the accelerators’ funds. Furthermore, accelerators located in the U.S., and those with the greatest longevity, are shown to have a higher impact on start-ups´ survival rates. The study is not free of limitations, but its findings contribute to the still scarce quantitative literature on the performance of accelerators, and provide important managerial implications for their managers, investors, and entrepreneurs.},

Second, digital scaleups, in line with the overall sample of digital new ventures, show a linear path of growth positively correlated with VC funding. Third, the relationship between funding received and growth in digital startups follows an inverted U–shape – with the optimal level within our sample set at 300,000\$. Finally, no evidence emerges on the angel groups contribution to the growth of digital new ventures in both startup and scaleup phase. These findings are hence discussed in the light of extant literature on venture financing as well as entrepreneurial bias literature, to provide insight for both researchers and practitioners in digital entrepreneurship.},

Conversely, are the effects of accelerators so isomorphic, because they copy each other, that ventures from different accelerators report little performance differences? We use variance decomposition analysis to test whether variations in characteristics of accelerators explain performance differences in the ventures that belong to them. Using a sample of 1,442 ventures from 117 accelerator programs across 22 countries, we find that 11.13–14.18\% variance of venture performance can be attributed to accelerator membership. Accelerator membership also accounted for 3.00, 5.15, and 16.65\% in the variance for employee growth, employee costs, and revenue change, respectively. Our findings suggest that between accelerator differences can make a significant economic difference to venture performance. Managerial summary For accelerator managers and policymakers assessing if differences between accelerators explain the differences in outcomes of member ventures is important. This article advances our understanding of differences among accelerators driving differences in performance among their ventures. Using a sample of 1,442 ventures from 117 accelerator programs across 22 countries, about 11\% variance of venture performance can be attributed to accelerator membership. Overall, differences among accelerators seem to explain meaningful differences in performance among member ventures.},

We examine whether startups join accelerators to alleviate financing constraints or to improve human capital for long-term growth. Using a novel three-stage two-sided matching econometric framework, we quantify and compare explanatory powers of short-term financing prospects and long-term growth prospects for the revealed preference during the accelerator admission process. We find that short-term financing prospects explain 48\% of the variations in the matching values, while variations of key five-year startup performance prospects can explain 96\%.},

This article explores whether all ventures benefit equally from participating in accelerator programs. We propose that the entrepreneurs’ human capital resources influence the benefits extracted from accelerator program participation. Using application data from the accelerator programs across developed and developing countries, we find participation in accelerator programs positively impacts the ventures’ innovation performance but has a mixed impact on social performance. Founders with high education benefit from participating in accelerator programs for innovation and social performance. However, entrepreneurial experience and vast industry experience do not significantly influence ventures’ social and innovation-related performance from accelerator participation. The result is consistent for both solo and team founders.},

Through our inductive process, we illuminate the bounded-rationality challenges that may plague all ventures and entrepreneurs—not just those in accelerators—and identify the particular organizational designs that accelerators use to help address these challenges, which left unabated can result in suboptimal performance or even venture failure. Our analysis revealed three key design choices made by accelerators—(1) whether to space out or concentrate consultations with mentors and customers, (2) whether to foster privacy or transparency between peer ventures participating in the same program, and (3) whether to tailor or standardize the program for each venture—and suggests a particular set of choices is associated with improved venture development. Collectively, our findings provide evidence that bounded rationality challenges new ventures differently than it does established firms. We find that entrepreneurs appear to systematically satisfice prematurely across many decisions and thus broadly benefit from increasing the amount of external information searched, often by reigniting search for problems that they already view as solved. Our study also contributes to research on organizational sponsors by revealing practices that help or hinder new venture development and to emerging research on the lean start-up methodology by suggesting that startups benefit from engaging in deep consultative learning prior to experimentation.},

However, despite the rapid proliferation of such programs, academic literature on the topic is surprisingly scarce.

To address this gap, we investigate how startups participating in accelerator programs can enhance innovation performance through sources of external knowledge provided by startup accelerators. In doing so, we draw data from 113 startups accelerated by Italian accelerators since 2013. Our results reveal that different sources of external knowledge provided by accelerators are beneficial for different innovation outcomes contributing to the literature on accelerators. Moreover, our findings contribute to the literature on startups and open innovation highlighting that different external sources of knowledge increase innovation performance of startups.},

From our review, it is clear that research has just begun to scratch the surface of the incubator-incubation phenomenon. While much attention has been devoted to the description of incubator facilities, less attention has been focused on the incubatees, the innovations they seek to diffuse, and the incubation outcomes that have been achieved. As interest in the incubator-incubation concept continues to grow, new research efforts should focus not only on these under-researched units of analysis, but also on the incubation process itself.},

Offering office space, funding, and basic services to start-ups, these organizations have become the hottest way to nurture and grow fledgling businesses. But are incubators a fleeting phenomenon born of an overheated stock market, or are they an important and lasting way of creating value and wealth in the new economy? The authors argue that one type of incubator, called a networked incubator, represents a fundamentally new and enduring organizational model uniquely suited to growing businesses in the Internet economy. It shares certain features with other incubators--mainly, it fosters a spirit of entrepreneurship and offers economies of scale. But its key distinguishing feature is its ability to give start-ups preferential access to a network of potential partners. Such incubators institutionalize their networking--they have systems in place to encourage networking, helping start-ups, for example, to meet with potential business allies. That doesn't mean incubatees get preferential treatment; it means only that they have built-in access to partnerships that might not have existed without the incubator. Even with this advantage, however, networked incubators can easily follow the road to ruin. To avoid failure, they must create a portfolio of companies and advisers that their incubatees can leverage. That can be done by strategically investing in portfolio firms and by enlisting a large set of business allies. It can also be done by establishing connections and relationships that are anchored more to the incubator than to particular individuals.},

A few literature reviews started summarizing the field, but left some important issues unanswered. This systematic review study contributes to this effort deriving current themes and a research agenda. We find that open innovation and social capital theory increasingly complement the resource-based view as frameworks to understand business incubation. Moreover, the phenomenon of private corporate incubators and accelerators gains traction, both in entrepreneurship theory and practice.},

Incubators are business support institutions designed to offer an array of services, such as space, infrastructure, advice, training and administrative support meant to accelerate the business start-up process. However, research within this topic is relatively young, and biased towards qualitative studies, focusing on firms within incubators. One of the findings of previous research is that entrepreneurs in incubators benefit from strong social networks; another is that they are prone to developing bureaucratic routines early on. In this study, we examine the characteristics of the firm owners’ networks and their use of business plans. We control for the bias of just studying firms within incubators by comparing incubated, and non-incubated firms. The network characteristics of incubated firm owners tended to be more business-related, with higher involvement of incubator managers and consultants. Incubated firms wrote longer business plans and made less use of family and friends.},

This systematic literature review (SLR) and the accompanying bibliometric analysis encompasses 38 publications, including 24 pieces of indigenous Mandarin literature. We aim to advance knowledge of incubator performance management (PM) and its link to incubator financial sustainability. Our aim is to explain the root causes of incubator PM ‘problems’, extract the extant performance problems evidenced within the Chinese incubator-incubation ecosystem, and assess the viability of dominant theoretical frameworks for the design of PM systems. We contend that incubator PM is multifaceted, owing to the hybrid nature of the incubator's organisational form. There is a need for further research to define incubator PM outcomes and unpack how PM metrics are linked or derived from specific incubator archetypes and modes of governance.},

A systematic literature review (SLR) was carried out encompassing the research topic concerning the relationship between the incubation structures and the performance of technology-based ventures. This comprehensive SLR encompasses a total of 1614 publications, aiming to advance the knowledge on BI and BA. This SLR allowed for the identification of current trends and future challenges, as well as of the most important authors, publications, and journals in this research framework. This SLR establishes a new taxonomy for BI and BA, based upon three main pillars: human capital, social capital, and organizational capital. BI and BA help in the development of new high-technology ventures, by being facilitators for open innovation practices. This SLR is limited by the literature, as the collection of publications was performed exclusively through ISI Web of Science (WoS). Further research can be made into the modes of how these structures impact open innovation practices at the regional level using a knowledge spillover approach.},

This study examines the short-term and long-term effects of business incubators on the performance of innovative start-ups in terms of sales revenues and job creation. A large sample of N\,=\,2544 innovative Italian start-ups, of which 606 were incubated, was followed over a period of up to six years. Tobit and Poisson regressions and propensity-score matching analyses point towards a significant negative effect of incubator tenancy on sales revenues and no significant effect of incubation on job creation. Findings also suggest that the initially negative effect of incubation on sales revenues turns into a positive effect in the long term. The effects of incubator characteristics, in terms of ownership, certification, and size on the growth of tenant start-ups were further analysed, but these effects were found to be negligible. The study contributes to the literature on the evidence-based evaluation of business incubation performance. It suggests that public policy makers should lower their expectations regarding the numbers of new jobs created by business incubation support.},

These evaluations provide evidence that accelerators and incubators raise participant employment, with accelerators also aiding access to finance. Ecosystem features such as university involvement and urban economic conditions also influence programme outcomes. However, evaluation evidence is less clear on detailed intervention design.

Incubators generate jobs and income and create linkages with firms inside and outside the local economy over the long run. The cost of creating these jobs is competitive with those costs associated with attracting manufacturing investment into a local community. Incubators can have an impact on communities that are not well positioned to attract such external investments.},

From this study of such a unit in the Republic of Ireland however, it became apparent that as the firms grew and sought to enhance credibility and protect market share, disadvantages emerged regarding incubator placement. Firm proximity created tensions concerning privacy, the protection of intellectual property and competitive strategies. It was also evident that as the firms became more mature, the need to develop independent, secure internal systems could be impeded by the ready availability of support and advice from the incubator management team.},

  abstract = {Purpose               The purpose of this study is to explore how do the characteristics of technology business incubators (TBIs), their chief executive officers, selection process and incubation process influence their research and development (R\&D) contributions to the national economy.                                         Design/methodology/approach               These research questions are probed based on primary data gathered from 65 TBIs located in Bangalore, Chennai and Hyderabad, 3 of the leading start-up hubs of India comprising 9 accelerators, 31 incubators and 25 co-working spaces. Stepwise (backward elimination) regression method has been applied for six regression models for the analysis of research objectives.                                         Findings               Incubators more than accelerators and co-working spaces have incurred R\&D investments for infrastructure development and hired exclusive R\&D personnel. External networks and size of incubators in terms of number of incubatees are decisive for R\&D investments and new products/services. TBIs accounted for a negligible share of patents relative to the number of new products/services generated in these TBIs, thereby indicating “low level of novelty/innovativeness” of new products/services. However, both new products/services and patent applications are crucial for revenue generation, implying that the generated new products/services are able to penetrate the market and patent application submission can act as a “signal” to the market.                                         Research limitations/implications               The overall research findings portend that there is scope and potential for an increasing R\&D contribution to emerge from the TBIs along with their incubated start-ups, to supplement the national R\&D efforts in India in the future. The emphasis, of course, has to be more on strengthening the innovation ecosystem through TBIs by means of industry–institute partnerships.                                         Practical implications               This study’s practical implications refer to the need to promote TBIs as a means of strengthening regional innovation systems in developing economies.                                         Social implications               TBIs can be a means of nurturing tech start-ups for generating employment and income in regional economies.                                         Originality/value               This is a first of its kind study with reference to an emerging economy exploring to understand the extent of R\&D contributions emerging from TBIs, which have been promoted on an increasing scale across the country as a means of nurturing technology start-ups.},

Offering office space, funding, and basic services to start-ups, these organizations have become the hottest way to nurture and grow fledgling businesses. But are incubators a fleeting phenomenon born of an overheated stock market, or are they an important and lasting way of creating value and wealth in the new economy? The authors argue that one type of incubator, called a networked incubator, represents a fundamentally new and enduring organizational model uniquely suited to growing businesses in the Internet economy. Its key distinguishing feature is its ability to give start-ups preferential access to a network of potential partners. Such incubators institutionalize their networking. That doesn't mean incubatees get preferential treatment; it means only that they have built-in access to partnerships that might not have existed without the incubator. Even with this advantage, however, networked incubators can easily follow the road to ruin. To avoid failure, they must create a portfolio of companies and advisers that their incubatees can leverage.},

This study investigated which performance indicators were related to the  plus-minus statistic in German recreational ice hockey players (n\,=\,20~players; 1~female; mean age\,=\,36.25\,±\,12.91~years; height\,=\,178.85\,±\,8.64\,cm; weight\,=\,81.36\,±\,12.89\,kg; mean years of ice hockey experience\,=\,5.68\,±\,8.93) over a season. Anthropometrics, psychological and on-ice performance data were collected mid-season and plus-minus were recorded after each game. Due to the small sample size, significance interpretations are not meaningful; therefore, Cohen’s guidelines were used for r\,=\,0.2 (small), r\,=\,0.5 (medium) and r\,=\,0.8 (large). Medium size positive correlations of plus/minus were found for push-ups (r\,=\,0.52) and squats (r\,=\,0.37). Small positive correlations were found for shot speed (r\,=\,0.33), competitiveness orientation (r\,=\,0.28), and years on team (r\,=\,0.23). Small negative correlations were found for win orientation (r\,=\,−0.30), body mass index (r\,=\,−0.28), task cohesion (r\,=\,−0.24), and percent body fat (r\,=\,−0.20). Some performance and psychological indicators are related to recreational ice hockey players’ plus-minus  statistic over a~season. Coaches and players of recreational teams should focus on muscular strength and endurance, shooting speed, body composition, and enjoying the challenge of competition while lowering their win orientation.},

  abstract = {The European startup and investment scene is quickly expanding: record levels of growth were
 identified in 2021, revealing this region lacks only in maturity of the ecosystem. Startup
 accelerators - the new generation of incubators - have picked up on this expansion and turned
 acceleration into a successful venture. As researchers continue to disagree on the conceptual and
 typological definitions of startup accelerators, their impact and ideal structure remain unclear.
 This dissertation aims to transpose a study conducted in the USA startup ecosystem to the
 European reality through intensive use of data and statistics. It looks into the relationships
 between the design variables of acceleration programs and the success - or lack thereof - of their
 graduated startups. Data was collected through a range of aggregators, news articles and websites
 and put through linear regression models in order to test the hypothesis that an accelerator’s
 structure impacts its startup’s chances of success. Our results reflect the positive effects of a large
 and diversified network of partners, sponsors, founders, and companies but struggled to explain
 the mechanisms behind startup success in full. Our data allowed us to distinguish between ill- and
 well-designed accelerators, establishing that the impact of the latter is stronger in both the shortand long-term, ultimately proposing the structure for an accelerator that maximises a startup’s
 chances of success.},

  abstract = {Business incubators (BIs) are important supporters for young businesses, since they provide firms with physical facilities and intangible support. Existing literature reviews focusing on BIs have neglected to consider individual factors in their success in favor of combining key performance measurements to identify their development targets. This systematic literature review thus aimed to combine studies that examined specific issues pertaining to BI performance and related key performance indicators to measure their activities. We conducted a systematic literature review based on two research questions: the first research question concerned critical factors for BIs’ performance; the second concerned their performance measurements. To ensure that we covered crucial factors and indicators of the latest generation of BIs, our systematic procedure included 74 studies published between 2005 and 2020 that were read in full and revealed ten critical factors that particularly emphasized financial resources and networking. We identified six categories for performance measurement, placing the greatest emphasis on the measurement of social capital. We recommend that academic researchers and BIs prioritize the intangible factors that constitute organizations’ hidden value. This review thus provides novel findings by identifying common critical factors for BIs’ performance and offering guidelines for performance measurement that consider BIs’ intangible assets and trends for future studies.},

The model is tested among three different types of incubators, for-profit, non-profit, university-based incubators. Based on our qualitative findings, we conclude that our initial model is ineffective, in the sense that it cannot fully explain the role of the incubators in facilitating entrepreneurship. Interviews with directors of incubator centers were also carried out simultaneously. Further analysis of the results along with interview responses from incubator directors, led us to propose a more comprehensive model to explain how incubators affect the entrepreneurial process.},

'Regret is not dangerous or abnormal, it is healthy and universal, an integral part of being human,' Daniel H. Pink writes in his provocative and eye-opening new book. 'Done right, it needn't bring us down; it can lift us up.' Drawing from new research in social psychology, neuroscience, biology, and more, as well as from more than ten thousand people in thirty-five countries around the world who responded to his World Regret Survey--the largest of its kind ever conducted--Pink challenges the idea of regret being a drag on our self-esteem and outlook. In fact, understanding how regret actually works and using those insights to reframe our perspective of it will help us reclaim regret as an indispensable emotion that can help us make smarter decisions, perform better at work and school, and bring greater meaning to our lives. As he did in his other paradigm-changing books When, Drive, and A Whole New Mind, Pink sets down a dynamic new way of thinking about regret and frames his ideas in ways that are clear, accessible, and pragmatic. Packed with true stories of people's regrets as well as practical takeaways for reimagining regret as a positive force in your own life, this book shows how we can live richer, more engaged lives--with no regrets"-- Provided by publisher},

  abstract = {Increasingly, entrepreneurs in search of critical early stage resources face an evolving paradigm: the rise of accelerators that integrate small equity investments with an intensive, cohort-based mentoring experience. The emergence of these accelerators attracts substantial interest in the popular imagination; however scholars know little about their overall impact. Specifically, in this paper we ask: What is the impact of receiving financing from a top accelerator, relative to that from a top angel group, on the subsequent trajectory of the venture- i.e., being acquired, deciding to quit, or obtaining follow-on funding from formal venture capitalists (VCs)? To answer this question, we bring to bear a novel, hand-collected dataset of n= 619 startups and their founders. We identify each cohort that has proceeded through two of the most established accelerators?Y Combinator and Tech Stars?from the period 2005-2011 and construct a matched sample of startups that instead receive their first formal financing from top angel investor groups. We find that participation in a top accelerator program increases the speed of exit. This occurs through two distinct channels: accelerators increase the likelihood of exit by acquisition as well as exit by quitting. We also find that participation in a top accelerator initially increases the speed of receiving follow-on funding from VC investors, particularly in the window surrounding the culminating ?Demo Day? presentations. However, in the longer term, participation in a top accelerator relative to a top angel group appears to decrease the speed?i.e. decelerate?the timing of follow-on funding from VCs.},

The study facilitates a better understanding of the incubation process and the mechanisms used to shape specific outcomes and performance. It also discusses future directions of research, and help policymakers and incubation managers design interventions according to the specific incubator type and incubation process context.},

  abstract = {Variance decomposition analysis allows partitioning the total variance in an outcome variable, e.g., firm performance, into several components. Such partitioning allows identifying groups of factors (e.g., firm-, industry-, and country-specific) that explain a significant portion of the variation in firm performance, thus helping researchers, managers, and policymakers better understand the sources of competitive advantage. The present study aims to inform scholars, particularly those in business-to-business (B2B) marketing, about the benefits of utilizing variance decomposition analysis and draw scholarly attention to the relevant statistical techniques needed to produce accurate estimates. We specifically point to multilevel modeling techniques due to their significant advantages over other approaches to decompose the variance in a given outcome variable. We provide a detailed step-by-step guide as well as the related Stata codes on conducting variance decomposition analysis with multilevel modeling techniques. Using a 10-year (2009–2018) dataset comprising 7281 distinct European B2B firms operating in 348 industries and 29 countries, we empirically examine the relative importance of firm, industry, country, year, and residual effects in driving firm performance for B2B firms. Our analysis shows that firm-specific factors have the highest relative importance for B2B firms' performance, followed by home country and industry effects.},
